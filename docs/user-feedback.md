1. [Quality] Suggested wrong improvement, corrected the wrong url instead of the actual command.
2. [User Test] Instructions should be clear
3. [User Test] It's not apparent how you proceed to the next command
4. [Quality] Give more structured info about the command in some cases
5. [Quality] Respond based on user level - too complicated
6. [Quality] Amount of info is less than it should be - interesting
7. [Quality] Time of suggestion should not be too long in day to day - maybe it's due to the experience level
8. [Quality] It should be able to be invoked after to prevent users from stuck waiting from a typo

Observations:
1. Should assert correct task completion to track time accurately

1. [User Test] First could try something different that works and may be confused
2. [User Test] Assertion of task
3. [User Test] Make moving forward more prominent how to continue
4. [Quality] Make it more documentation like based on the command
5. [Idea] Assert successful output to make sure it helps the user
6. [Idea] Ask llm to provide the command
7. [User Test] Add more real life examples of command (e.g awk may not fail)
8. [Quality] Amount of info was ok but it could be more, it's not too much - 
9. [Idea] Could give possible alternatives
10. [Quality] Time of suggestions is a problem, maybe interupt it
11. [Quality] Maybe worth the time with what it offers comparison to time
12. [Idea for user tests] Docker commands?
13. [Idea for user tests] GCC commands?
14. [Idea] Define the user level and assert output
15. [Idea] Could take the intent and start suggesting commands and give feedback when necesary
