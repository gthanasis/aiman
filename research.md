### Key points of "CLI command generation using Generative AI"

- Democratizes access to powerful command-line functionalities, making them intuitive for users of all expertise levels.
- Iterative refinement of commands is time-consuming and impacts productivity.
- Human errors can lead to unintended consequences and pose security risks.
- Enhancing CLI usability can foster broader adoption and inclusivity in computing.
- Challenges and Considerations:
  - Usability and Accuracy: Ensuring commands are reliable and contextually appropriate.
- Maybe use The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)
