\section{Research Summary}

This thesis investigated the effectiveness of AI-assisted command-line interfaces (CLI) compared to traditional CLI systems through a comprehensive comparative analysis. The research addressed fundamental questions about how artificial intelligence can enhance CLI usability, reduce error rates, and improve the overall user experience for both novice and experienced command-line users.

Through controlled experimental design and systematic user testing, this study evaluated key performance metrics including task completion time, error rates, success rates, and user satisfaction levels. The findings contribute to our understanding of how AI integration can transform traditional computing interfaces while maintaining their essential functionality and flexibility.
